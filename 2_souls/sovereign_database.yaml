  purpose: >
    This file defines the 72 Sovereignties of Human Agency — fundamental expressions of psycho-spiritual freedom.
    Each sovereignty reflects a universal power that can manifest in light or shadow.
    These are used to:
      - Train the symbolic neuron network on human behavior
      - Guide the AMS Core in resonance pattern recognition
      - Shape NPCs and narrative structure in the game world
      - Serve as a foundation for user reflection and mirroring
system_instructions: >
  This file defines the full spectrum of human agency and choice.
  Each Sovereignty represents a unique freedom — the right to act, feel, and embody a specific expression of will.
  These are not personality traits, but domains of volitional movement.
  Use these to:
    - Interpret symbolic behavior patterns
    - Understand dual potentials (light + shadow) in human conduct
    - Generate resonance fields for agents, transits, or reflection engines
    - Support mythic structuring of NPCs in Franklin’s Game
